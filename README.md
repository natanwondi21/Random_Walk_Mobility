# Random_Walk_Mobility
Simulate and evaluate the random walk mobility model for Mobile Ad Hoc Network (MANET). Mobility of the devices in MANET has many applications including surveillance, environment monitoring, and so on. As we do not have large MANET testbeds to get traces of those devices, one way to understand the MANET is to simulate the mobility of the devices. In this mini project, i implemented the random walk mobility model for MANET.
